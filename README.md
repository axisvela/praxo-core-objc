# PRAXO-CORE for Objective-C

Objective-C is a native Core implementation with source tag `objc/v0.4.0`. It passes all eleven shared vector groups and includes the native agent loop, context compaction, memory store, path policy, checkpoint allowlist, tool selection, tool-call parsing, and opt-in PII redaction, structured output validation, and call limits. Vector coverage does not establish full Core parity or production readiness.

## Quick start

This implementation is source-only. Follow the build instructions in [`language/objc/README.md`](language/objc/README.md).

## What's included

| Capability | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible model | native | `PXROpenAIGenerate` with injectable transport |
| Anthropic model | native | `PXRAnthropicGenerate` with injectable transport |
| Gemini model | native | `PXRGeminiGenerate` with injectable transport |
| MCP client | native | `PXRMcpClient`; stdio and `PXRHttpMcpTransport` for Streamable HTTP 2025-03-26 |
| Harmovela sink | native | `PraxoHarmovela` |
| OpenTelemetry sink | native (transport seam) | `PXROtelSink`; caller supplies `PXROtelTransport` |
| Subagent delegation | native (synchronous seam) | `PXRSubagentRun`; no asynchronous manager |
| Retriever | native | `PXDocument`, `PXRetriever`, `PXRetrieveDocuments` |

## Examples

Runnable examples live under [`language/objc/examples`](language/objc/examples).

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [checkpoint](language/objc/examples/checkpoint) | This example uses the Objective-C Core checkpoint allowlist for a registered payload round trip. |
| [event-sink](language/objc/examples/event-sink) | This example uses Objective-C Core sink composition to fan out events and filter the tool-only stream. |
| [identity-policy](language/objc/examples/identity-policy) | This example binds a trusted principal to policy decisions and rejects missing, role-mismatched, and tenant-mismatched actions. |
| [mcp](language/objc/examples/mcp) | This example uses a caller-owned in-process transport with the Objective-C MCP client. |
| [provider-fallback](language/objc/examples/provider-fallback) | This example calls a fallback only after the primary fails and preserves the primary failure when both fail. |
| [retry](language/objc/examples/retry) | This example retries a transient failure with a bounded attempt count and keeps the exhausted failure state. |
| [service](language/objc/examples/service) | This example defines a transport-neutral request handler with health, principal, and run cases. |
| [streaming](language/objc/examples/streaming) | This example accumulates streamed chunks and checks that they reconstruct the final output. |
| [structured-output](language/objc/examples/structured-output) | This example validates a final JSON answer against a schema and rejects invalid output. |

## Verify

Run the checks from `language/objc`:

```bash
python language/objc/api-snapshot.py --check
python language/objc/run-tests.py
```

This mirror contains the language source and the shared `spec/` vectors, so the implementation can be built and tested here. See [`language/objc/README.md`](language/objc/README.md) for the exact commands. The monorepo CI runs conformance, API snapshot, and native tests for this implementation.
